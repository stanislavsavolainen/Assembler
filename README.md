Assembler programming ( mostly pc 32 bit x86-architecture i386)


I am using NASM ( Netwide Assembler ) compiler for assembly programming on Linux and Windows.

This repository is for learnign purpose. Maybe someone can also benefit from it.


Ubnuntu 32 bit compile command  : 
 nasm -f elf string1.asm
 ld -s -o string1 string1.o
 ./string1

   

Project1 : Hello World 
 -> "ubuntu32bit"  
 -> "win32" where mingw32 as linker

http://asm.sourceforge.net/intro/hello.html


Project2 : Loops where conditional label jump
 -> ubuntu32bit
 -> "win32" where mingw32 as linker
